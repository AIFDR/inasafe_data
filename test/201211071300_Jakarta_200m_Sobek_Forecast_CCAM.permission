Dear Ole,

Sorry for my late reply. It have been a few hectic weeks. I've had a look at the links you send below and I don't see any problems in including one of the forecast floodmaps from the Fews system like you suggest. As long as there is a disclaimer included that it is an example floodmap resulting from a Sobek hydrodynamic calculation exported by Delft-FEWS software, and that the map is used for demonstration purposes only and as such the results are not to be used in any decision making.

For your information, we are about to start a new project (FMIS, Flood Management Information System) which focuses on Jakarta and within that project we are going to update the Sobek hydrodynamic model and associated hydrometeorological input together with PU DKI an Balai Besar Ciliwung Cisadane. By the end of the year the flood layers should be formally available hopefully before the start of the rain season.

Do let us know if you have any additional data requirements or have further suggestions on how to best deliver the maps to you through FEWS.

Kind regards,
Ronald.

Hi Ole,

some recent forecasts show floodings in North Jakarta. Attached an example. Since this is based on a somewhat old model, I don't think the forecast can be trusted. In a couple of weeks we will implement the new model. But, with the results of this old model I can give you a nethcid file containing water levels in the current format. As can be seen in the screenshot below, it contains information about the coordinate system. Is this how you expect the output data?

Notice also that the file name of the output file has changed: it is now based on the CCAM weather forecast of BMKG.

Kind regards,
Arnejan
